Final
- enforces proper separation of concerns:
- keeping on the client almost all presentation logic
  - less room for hacks on the front end: no hidden form fields, flash attributes etc
  - less room for hacks on the backend : do not put nothing in session

Result set Streaming
- remove temporary allocation of big list in memory
- short-circuit resultset iteration with output
- usability: give user immediate feedback

Oracle JDBC cursors
- fetch multiple resultset with one database roundtrip
- ideal for fetching
- "real" eager fetching

Javascript
- discipline and rigor
- strong unit testing practices
- on IE9+ we can use ES5
- 'use strict' (not available IE9)
- use jshint to catch bugs as soon as possible
